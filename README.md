# Structure-preserving machine learning for physical systems

**NLDL 2025 Winter School Tutorial**

This repository contains three notebooks with introductory exercises on physics-informed machine learning.

* Exercise 0: Physics-informed neural network (PINN) for modelling a dampen mass-spring system
* Exercise 1: Pseudo-Hamiltonian neural network (PHNN) for modelling a damped mass-spring system
* Exercise 2: Hamiltonian neural network (HNN) for modelling the Kortewegâ€“de Vries equation
